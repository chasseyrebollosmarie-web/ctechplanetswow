  <h1>🪐 Saturn</h1>
  <img src="saturn.jpg" alt="Saturn" class="planet-img">
  <p>Saturn is famous for its stunning icy rings made of ice, dust, and rock particles. Despite being huge, it’s so light it could float in water! Saturn has over 80 moons, and Titan, the largest, has lakes of liquid methane and a thick atmosphere. Its rings are made of countless particles, and it spins very fast, giving it a flattened shape at the poles.</p>

    <h1>🌕 Jupiter</h1>
    <img src="jupiter.jpg" alt="jupiter" class="planet-img">
  <p>Jupiter is the largest planet big enough to fit 1,300 Earths inside! Its Great Red Spot is a storm that has lasted over 300 years. Its moons, like Europa and Io, Europa may have an ocean under its icy surface. Jupiter’s gravity helps protect Earth by pulling in asteroids.

    <h1>🌍 Earth</h1>
<img src="earth.jpg" alt="earth" class="planet-img">
  <p>Earth is the only planet with liquid water and life. About 70% of its surface is oceans, containing most of the planet’s life. Its atmosphere and magnetic field protect life from harmful radiation. Earth rotates to create day and night and revolves around the Sun to create seasons.</p>

  <section id="moon" class="planet">
    <h1>🌙 Moon</h1>
    <img src="moon.jpg" alt="moon" class="planet-img">
  <p>The Moon slowly drifts away from Earth at about 3.8 cm per year. It controls tides and affects some animal behaviors. Its cratered surface tells stories of ancient impacts. The Moon has no atmosphere, so temperatures change drastically between day and night.

    <h1>Mars</h1>
    <img src="mars.jpg" alt="mars" class="planet-img">
  <p>Mars is the Red Planet, known for its iron-rich surface. It has the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and signs that rivers and lakes existed long ago. Dust storms can cover the whole planet. Scientists hope Mars might have hosted tiny life forms in the past.

  <h1>Venus</h1>
  <img src="venus.jpg" alt="venus" class="planet-img">
  <p>Venus is the brightest planet in the night sky and is often called Earth’s twin because of its similar size. Its surface is hotter than Mercury, and its thick clouds contain sulfuric acid. Venus spins backward slowly and shines brilliantly, making it a dazzling planet to observe.
